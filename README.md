# Shopping Management System
* The idea is that there are 10 different tshirts/shirts available in this virtual shop with 10 different brand names 
* The program will ask if the customer wants to see the list of available tshirts/shirts
* The customer will type "yes" and the program will display a list of all the available tshirts with different attributes like colour,      size, brand, price
* The customer will select one option if they want to buy only one item and type multiple options if they want to buy more than one item 
* The user will be taken to the cashier to pay the amount 
* The customer can either pay by cash or credit card
* If they select credit card then they will have to enter a 6 digit pin to complete the transaction
* So now his remaining balance would be Total - price of the tshirt/shirt
* The program will then send a thank you message and exit the system
